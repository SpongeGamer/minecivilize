Hello! I'm experiencing issues with armor textures in NeoForge 1.21.x. There seems to be a discrepancy between the documentation and the actual implementation.

Issue Description:
The armor is functional (protection values and equip sounds work), but textures are invisible on armor stands and players.

Current Implementation:

1. Armor Material (BronzeArmorMaterial.java):
```java
public class BronzeArmorMaterial {
    private static final EnumMap<ArmorItem.Type, Integer> PROTECTION_VALUES = Util.make(new EnumMap<>(ArmorItem.Type.class), map -> {
        map.put(ArmorItem.Type.BOOTS, 2);
        map.put(ArmorItem.Type.LEGGINGS, 5);
        map.put(ArmorItem.Type.CHESTPLATE, 6);
        map.put(ArmorItem.Type.HELMET, 2);
    });

    public static final ArmorMaterial BRONZE = new ArmorMaterial(
        PROTECTION_VALUES,
        12, // enchantability
        SoundEvents.ARMOR_EQUIP_IRON,
        () -> Ingredient.of(Items.COPPER_INGOT),
        List.of(),
        0.0F, // toughness
        0.0F  // knockbackResistance
    );
}
```

2. Equipment JSON (assets/minecivilize/equipment/bronze.json):
```json
{
  "layers": {
    "humanoid": [
      {
        "texture": "minecivilize:entity/equipment/bronze_layer_1"
      }
    ],
    "humanoid_leggings": [
      {
        "texture": "minecivilize:entity/equipment/bronze_layer_2"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3. Texture files are located at:
- assets/minecivilize/textures/entity/equipment/bronze_layer_1.png
- assets/minecivilize/textures/entity/equipment/bronze_layer_2.png

Issues with Documentation:

1. According to the docs (https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/1.21.x/armor/), we should:
   - Implement ArmorMaterial as an interface
   - Use ResourceKey.create(EquipmentAssets.ROOT_ID, ResourceLocation.fromNamespaceAndPath("minecivilize", "bronze"))
   - Register the equipment asset using EquipmentAssets.register()

2. However:
   - ArmorMaterial appears to be a class, not an interface
   - The package net.neoforged.neoforge.common.EquipmentAssets doesn't exist
   - The ArmorMaterial constructor doesn't match the one shown in documentation

I've tried:
1. Using the constructor approach (current implementation)
2. Implementing ArmorMaterial as an interface (compilation errors)
3. Registering equipment assets in the mod's constructor (EquipmentAssets class not found)

Questions:
1. What is the correct way to implement custom armor textures in NeoForge 1.21.x?
2. Is the documentation outdated?
3. If EquipmentAssets is the correct approach, which package contains this class?

Environment:
- NeoForge version: 1.21.x
- Operating System: Windows
- Development Environment: MCreator

Thank you for your help!
